## Notes
### 5.1
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications and the arts
- Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended
- The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses but can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
- Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a  harmful impact on society, the economy or culture

### 5.2
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem
