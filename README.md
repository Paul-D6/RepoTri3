## Notes
### 5.1
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications and the arts
- Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended
- The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses but can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
- Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a  harmful impact on society, the economy or culture

### 5.2
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem

## Create Task
- Planning
- Responses
- - [x] Instructions for input: User will be able to select whether or not they would like to add a book to their wishlist. There will be 5 options to choose from that the user will decide on
- [x] Use of at least 1 list: The books that will be prompted will be from a question list. A list will also be created as the user decides on the books that they like.(push-js)
- - [x] At least 1 procedure: The procedure will be taking the input from a user and the function will produce a list of books that they wanted to add to their wishlist
- - [x] An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure: The function runs through a loop that adds questions to a list and shuffles them. There will be different parts to this and only certain action will occur when  specific conditions are met. Ex: If the user likes the book, the function will add it to a list.
- - [x] Calls to your student-developed procedure: the "next" button will switch to different question and allow the user to decide on the next book they want to add
- - [x] Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input program functionality: The output will be a textual list of books that the user created
