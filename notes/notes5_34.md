## Notes

### 5.3 
- Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time
- Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.
- Distributed computing is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program
- Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes to perform the same task
- A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps
- A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.
- The “speedup” of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel
### 5.4
- Distributive computing
- - Use it to compute faster
- - Citizen science
- - Giving citizens control of scientific research as long as it isn’t too demanding so the actual scientists can collect the data and use it
- Crowdsourcing
- - Gaining information and data by obtaining the services of a large group of people
 
### Question Responses
- 5.3
- Any program can be biased when the creators do not account for all types of people. In the video we learned that because the program didn’t categorize different races, it was not able to identify other people with darker skin tones
Bias can be unintentional.
- 5.4
- - A crowd sourcing idea could be whether the computer science students find a certain TPT difficult to understand or not
- - I can get a wide variety of people with different interests in different grades. I can use this info to help adjust my websites functions
