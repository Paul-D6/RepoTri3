## Notes
### 5.1
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications and the arts
- Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended
- The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community
- Targeted advertising is used to help businesses but can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
- Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
- Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a  harmful impact on society, the economy or culture

### 5.2
- A decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct output for all inputs
- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer.
- An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem
### 5.3 
- Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time
- Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.
- Distributed computing is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program
- Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes to perform the same task
- A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps
- A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.
- The “speedup” of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel
### 5.4
- Distributive computing
- - Use it to compute faster
- - Citizen science
- - Giving citizens control of scientific research as long as it isn’t too demanding so the actual scientists can collect the data and use it
- Crowdsourcing
- - Gaining information and data by obtaining the services of a large group of people
### Question Responses
- 5.1
- - A benefit is people can use computers to supplement life skills so they will not have to do it. The downside in this is, is that people will become reliant on computers and some people might loose their job.
- - A benefit is that communication is a lot faster which allows people to be updated in a short amount of time. The negative affect on this is people will be more likely to stop the traditional, personal interaction and prefer to communicate digitally.
- - I would say that dopamine issues are very real, especially for people that have a lot of work. These people would rather give themselves more breaks in between assignments than to focus and get their work done. I am personally distracted with social media and other applications on my phone when trying to get my work done sometimes It is a serious problem that almost everyone faces, and could affect the amount of time something gets done.
- 5.2
- - To empower yourself in the digital world, it is ideal to use technology in innovative ways. By using their skills to solve problems and benefit others, it is a great example of what makes someone empowered. Being empowered in the digital world also requires someone to have access to technology and internet services, and due to the digital divide, not everyone does.
- - An empowered person can help a non-empowered person by helping them solve problems that they would originally not be able to solve. For example, I could build a website or platform that benefits a people in a way that people. could not have. done. before.
- - I think paper and red tape does contribute to blocking digital empowerment. At school, there are certain websites that are blocked by the wifi (“red tape”). The websites could potentially be usefull and they prevent certain classes from being digitally empowered. Paper is also used in certain feilds of study, which prevents the classes from becoming digitally empowered.

- 5.3
- Any program can be biased when the creators do not account for all types of people. In the video we learned that because the program didn’t categorize different races, it was not able to identify other people with darker skin tones
Bias can be unintentional.
- 5.4
- - A crowd sourcing idea could be whether the computer science students find a certain TPT difficult to understand or not
- - I can get a wide variety of people with different interests in different grades. I can use this info to help adjust my websites functions
